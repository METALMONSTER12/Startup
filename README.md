# Connect Four

[My Notes](notes.md)

This is the game Connect Four. The goal of this game is to place 4 circles in a way that it creates either a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line. The game goes back and forth between turns until either the board is full in which case it is a draw or one player wins.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [X] Proper use of Markdown

### Elevator pitch

Have you ever wanted to play connect 4 online but have not had any good options for playing with friends online without interuptions? Well with this website all your problems are solved! This website has an easy free to play no ad game that can be played from anywhere. Don't know how to play? There is an entire page that explains the game for those who have not been introduced to the wonderful world of connect four.  

### Design

<div style="display: flex;">
  <img src="Connect4-Login.jpg" alt="Login page" width="300">
  <img src="Connect4-Home.jpg" alt="Home page" width="300">
</div>


There will be two main pages (unless later I decide I need an about page as well) a login page and a main page. The login page will have the basic information for login and a place to put in the username and password. The main page will have the actual game where you can play and will include instructions to the side along with a link to logout in the top corner. It will also have some form of information that will be accessed through a API but I have not decided on that yet a few ideas I could implement are images, quotes, or jokes. 

### Key features

- Login with secure HTTPS
- Highest scores are displayed
- Random inspirational quote is displayed every time it is opened
- Easy interface to play against friends 
- Really fun and easy to learn

- **Service** - Backend services for loginning in and retreving scores
