            <h2>About This Game</h2>
            <p>Connect Four is a two-player connection game in which the players first choose a color and then take turns dropping colored discs from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the next available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs. Connect Four is a solved game. The first player can always win by playing the right moves.</p>
            <h2>How to Play</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Choose your color (Red or Yellow).</li>
                <li>Take turns dropping your colored disc into one of the seven columns.</li>
                <li>The disc will occupy the lowest available space in that column.</li>
                <li>The first player to connect four of their discs in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins!</li>
                <li>If the board fills up without any player connecting four, the game ends in a draw.</li>
            </ol>
